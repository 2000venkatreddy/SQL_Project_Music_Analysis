# 🎵 Music Store Data Analysis 

This project is a **guided SQL-based data analysis** of a music store database. It helped me practice real-world SQL queries to derive insights from a relational schema, similar to what's used in commercial music platforms.

## 📌 Project Highlights

- ✅ **Project Type:** Guided Learning  
- 🧑‍💻 **Skill Level:** Beginner to Intermediate  
- 🔍 **Focus Areas:** SQL Queries, Joins, Aggregations, CTEs, Subqueries, and Grouping

## 📂 Project Structure

- 🧩 **ER Diagram** – Visualizes the database schema and relationships ([`MusicDatabaseSchema.png`](./MusicDatabaseSchema.png))
- 📄 **SQL Queries** – All queries used to solve business questions ([`SQL_Project_Query.sql`](./SQL_Project_Query.sql))
- 📝 **Problem Set** – Original set of analytical questions from the guided project ([`Music Store Analysis-Questions.pdf`](./Music%20Store%20Analysis-Questions.pdf))

## 🧠 What I Learned

- 🧮 Writing complex SQL queries using `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, and `HAVING`
- 🧱 Using **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)** for layered logic and clarity
- 📊 Extracting actionable business insights from raw transactional data
- 🏆 Identifying key metrics like top customers, best cities for promotion, and popular genres
